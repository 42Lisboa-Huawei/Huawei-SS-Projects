        "> In cryptography, a **Caesar cipher**, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. **It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet**. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.\n",
